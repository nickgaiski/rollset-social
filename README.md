## What is Rollset Social?

Rollset Social is a social media scheduling tool you run yourself. Connect your accounts, draft a post once, and send it to every network at the same time — or queue it to go out on a recurring schedule. No monthly seat fees, no third party holding your tokens or your data.

It's built for individuals and teams: invite collaborators into a shared workspace, keep clients or brands separated, and see how your posts perform — all from a single, fast interface.

## Why Rollset Social?

- **You own everything** — your posts, your audience tokens, your analytics. Self-hosted on your infrastructure.
- **One post, every platform** — compose once and publish to multiple accounts, tweaking the text per network when you want.
- **Plan ahead** — a posting queue with recurring time slots and a month calendar, so your feed stays consistent without you babysitting it.
- **Made for teams** — workspaces, roles, and email invites keep clients and collaborators tidy.
- **No vendor lock-in** — open source under the Apache 2.0 license, runs anywhere Docker does.

## Supported platforms

## Features

- 📝 **Composer** — draft with media and alt text, see live per-account text and video limits (including detected X subscription limits), and automatically split long posts into threads where the platform supports it.
- 🚀 **Multi-account publishing** — fan one post out to many accounts at once, with optional per-platform overrides. Each target publishes independently and retries on failure.
- 🗓️ **Queue & calendar** — set recurring posting slots (in your workspace's timezone), drop drafts into the queue, and review everything on a month calendar. Publish instantly whenever you like.
- 📊 **Analytics** — follower and post-count trends per account, plus per-post engagement (likes, reposts, replies, impressions) where the provider API supports it.
- 🔗 **Connected accounts** — link accounts via OAuth (X, LinkedIn) or app password (Bluesky), group them into reusable sets, and get nudged when one needs reconnecting. Tokens are stored encrypted and refreshed automatically; a successful authenticated X tier refresh also restores a stale attention state.
- 👥 **Workspaces & team** — multiple workspaces with role-based memberships, email invitations, and ownership transfer. Every bit of data is scoped to its workspace.
- 🔔 **Notifications** — in-app alerts when a post publishes or fails, or when an account needs attention.
- 🔐 **Secure by default** — email/password with verification, two-factor (TOTP), passkeys (WebAuthn), and optional social login (Google, X, LinkedIn).

## Self-hosting

Build Rollset Social from this repository so you run this fork's chrome, not the upstream image.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickgaiski/rollset-social.git
cd rollset-social
cp .env.example.prod .env
```

Set `APP_KEY`, `APP_URL`, and `APP_ENV=production` in `.env`. Generate a key:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.development.yaml run --rm --build app php artisan key:generate --show
```

Paste the key into `.env`, then start from source:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.development.yaml up -d --build
```

That Compose file builds the image from this repo's `Dockerfile`. `docker-compose.production.yaml` is the production-env counterpart and also builds from this repo's `Dockerfile`. It runs the web app, queue worker, and scheduler in one container — ideal for a single box. It defaults to SQLite with no external services, and you can switch to Postgres/Redis later if you need to scale out.

Rollset Social runs its startup tasks automatically, including database migrations. Open `http://localhost:8080`, register the first account, and you're in.

The app accepts videos up to Rollset Social's 1 GiB application ceiling by default. Local-disk uploads stream the request body straight to storage and the app bounds how many bytes it writes, so memory and disk usage stay flat no matter the video size. If you place it behind a reverse proxy, set that proxy's request-body limit to at least 1.1 GiB too, and keep `PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE` above the ceiling so a legitimate large upload isn't rejected up front. For large or production deployments, configure S3-compatible object storage (`FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3`): uploads then go directly to storage and never pass through the app at all.

For a real public deployment, set `APP_URL` to your HTTPS domain and set `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`.

To reset all local test data:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.development.yaml down -v
```

Set `INERTIA_SSR_ENABLED=true` for server-side rendering. To run the worker/scheduler as separate services in the cloud, set `QUEUE_WORKER_ENABLED=false` / `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` and override the container command (e.g. `php artisan queue:work`).

### Deploy with Docker Compose from this repo

Any Compose-capable host (including [Coolify](https://coolify.io)) can deploy Rollset Social from this repo using the bundled Compose file — it handles the domain, HTTPS, and persistent volumes for you.

1. Create a new resource from **Public Repository** (or Private, via a GitHub App). Enter `https://github.com/nickgaiski/rollset-social`.
2. Set the **Build Pack** to **Docker Compose** and the **Docker Compose file** to `docker-compose.development.yaml`.
3. Under the `app` service, add a **Domain** pointing at port **8080**. TLS is typically provisioned automatically.
4. Add these **Environment Variables**:

    | Variable    | Value                                                                        |
    | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `APP_KEY`   | a Laravel key — generate one with `php artisan key:generate --show`          |
    | `APP_URL`   | your domain, e.g. `https://social.example.com` (must match the domain above) |
    | `APP_ENV`   | `production`                                                                 |
    | `APP_DEBUG` | `false`                                                                      |

    Add your `X_*`, `LINKEDIN_*`, `FACEBOOK_*`, `THREADS_*`, and optional `GOOGLE_*` credentials here too (see [Connecting your accounts](#connecting-your-accounts)).

5. Click **Deploy**.

The Compose file declares named volumes for `storage` and the SQLite database, so your data and uploads survive redeploys. To run against managed Postgres/Redis instead, point the `DB_*` / `REDIS_*` env vars at them and switch `DB_CONNECTION`, `CACHE_STORE`, and `QUEUE_CONNECTION` accordingly.

### Security headers & Content-Security-Policy

Outside `local`, Rollset Social sends a strict, nonce-based **Content-Security-Policy** along with `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and (in production) `Strict-Transport-Security`. This is deliberate hardening — but if you customise the frontend or front the app with an unusual proxy/CDN, it's the first place to look when something renders wrong.

**If the UI loads unstyled or a feature is broken, open your browser's dev console and check for CSP violations.** Common causes and fixes (all in `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`):

- **Assets served from a different origin than `APP_URL`** (e.g. a CDN host) are blocked by `default-src 'self'`. Serve built assets from the app origin, or add the host to `script-src`/`style-src`/`img-src`.
- **Third-party embeds or analytics scripts** are blocked — `script-src` only trusts the app's own nonced scripts (`'strict-dynamic'`). Add the source explicitly if you need it.
- **Images/avatars from arbitrary hosts** are allowed (`img-src` permits `https:`); tighten this if you prefer.

The CSP is intentionally **not** sent in `local` (`APP_ENV=local`) because it is incompatible with the Vite dev server's hot-reload. To verify the production policy locally, run a build and serve with a non-local env (`bun run build && APP_ENV=production php artisan serve`). Note that `Strict-Transport-Security` requires the app to be served over HTTPS.

## Connecting your accounts

**Bluesky** connects two ways, and neither needs you to register a developer app:

- **OAuth (recommended)** — users sign in on Bluesky and authorize Rollset Social without handing over a password. It's zero-config: Rollset Social publishes an [ATProto OAuth](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth) client-metadata document at `${APP_URL}/oauth/bluesky/client-metadata.json` (with keys at `${APP_URL}/oauth/bluesky/jwks.json`), and Bluesky's authorization server fetches those to identify your instance. The signing key is generated once and stored encrypted — there's nothing to add to `.env`. **The one requirement:** `APP_URL` must be a public HTTPS URL, because Bluesky has to reach those two documents over the internet. (In `local` dev, Rollset Social falls back to a loopback client so OAuth still works on `localhost`.)
- **App password** — users paste a Bluesky [app password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords). No setup, and it works anywhere — including private or LAN deployments Bluesky can't reach for OAuth.

**X**, **LinkedIn**, and the **Meta** platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Threads) publish through your own developer app, so you'll register one with each provider and add the credentials to `.env`. The redirect URIs must match what you register (they default to `${APP_URL}/...`):

```dotenv
# X — https://developer.x.com
X_CLIENT_ID=
X_CLIENT_SECRET=
X_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/x"

# LinkedIn — https://www.linkedin.com/developers
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=
LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/linkedin"

# Facebook + Instagram — one Meta app (https://developers.facebook.com).
# Instagram accounts are discovered via their linked Facebook Pages, so both
# platforms share these credentials. Publishing to non-test accounts requires
# Meta App Review + Business Verification.
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=
FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/meta"

# Threads — a separate Meta app (https://developers.facebook.com).
THREADS_CLIENT_ID=
THREADS_CLIENT_SECRET=
THREADS_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/threads"
```

Optionally, let people sign in with a social account instead of a password:

```dotenv
SOCIALITE_ENABLED=true
SOCIALITE_PROVIDERS=google            # comma-separated: google,x,linkedin
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/auth/google/callback"
```

> **Heads up:** publishing, scheduling, engagement polling, and analytics capture rely on a running queue worker and scheduler. The provided Docker setups start both for you. Metrics and engagement are enabled by default and can be disabled with `METRICS_ENABLED=false` / `ENGAGEMENT_ENABLED=false` (see `config/metrics.php` and `config/engagement.php`). X accounts read the authenticated account's subscription type when connected or when **Refresh tier** is used in Connected Accounts; Free accounts use a 280-character / 140-second-video limit, while Basic, Premium, and Premium+ accounts use 25,000 characters and can upload videos up to four hours. When a post targets more than one X account, the composer enforces the strictest selected account limit.

## Development

Rollset Social is a Laravel 13 (PHP 8.5) app with a React 19 + TypeScript frontend on [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) v3, [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). It runs on [Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/octane) (FrankenPHP), with typed routes generated by [Wayfinder](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder).

```bash
composer setup   # install deps, copy .env, generate app + Passport keys, bun install, build assets
composer dev     # serve + queue + scheduler + logs + Vite, all at once
```

> Uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) for the frontend (`bun install`, `bun run …`) — not npm/pnpm.

To test SMTP locally during development, run [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit):

```bash
docker run --rm --name mail --pull always -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 axllent/mailpit:latest
```

Then set these mail values in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_SCHEME=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@rollset.app"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### How publishing works

A post is composed once, then split into one **target** per connected account. The scheduler dispatches due posts every minute; a queued `PublishPostTarget` job then publishes each target independently, with retries, idempotency, and a per-attempt audit trail. Scheduled jobs refresh OAuth tokens before they expire, fetch replies, and check for due metrics captures every 15 minutes. Metrics refresh cadence is controlled in `config/metrics.php`.

### API & MCP tokens

The REST API and MCP integration authenticate with bearer tokens minted by [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/passport), which signs and verifies every token with an RSA keypair. **You don't need to provision these keys** — the first time a workspace issues an API key, Rollset Social generates the pair automatically (`ApiKeyManager::ensureEncryptionKeysExist()` runs `passport:keys`) and stores it in `storage/oauth-private.key` / `oauth-public.key`. The bundled Docker setups persist `storage` on a named volume, so the keys survive redeploys.

If you'd rather provision them explicitly — for example to share one keypair across multiple app instances behind a load balancer — do either of the following before issuing keys:

- Run `php artisan passport:keys` once and keep `storage` persistent, **or**
- Set the `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `PASSPORT_PUBLIC_KEY` env vars to the key contents (the auto-generation step is skipped when both are present).

To turn auto-generation off entirely, set `PASSPORT_AUTO_GENERATE_KEYS=false`. Issuing an API key without keys present then fails loudly instead of writing new ones — useful when the keypair is managed externally and Rollset Social must never mint its own.
